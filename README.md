On October 30th, 2018 Apple held an [event](https://www.apple.com/apple-events/october-2018/) in New York, announcing new iPad Pros, MacBook Air and Mac mini.
For the invites to the press Apple commissioned [hundreds of interesting and creative logos](https://www.macrumors.com/2018/10/24/all-the-apple-logos/). It feels like a waste of amazing creativity to not do anything more permanent with this art. 

October 30 is a macOS screen saver (requires El Capitan or later) that randomly changes between these 371 Apple logos.

_(The GIF above is just for intro. Actually logos change smoothly and more slowly.)_

### Install
